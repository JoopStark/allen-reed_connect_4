# connect_4

## Written Reflection
1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project? We used a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFqtgU31jdK4ehxHeiXQDV0fANM9DvrjGI5zeJKwljQ/edit) to layout the foundation for how the game would function and how we would store the information.  This also included win conditions for horizontal, vertical and diagonal.  Most problem solving was done in real time, the expection we chose to do a code spike to figure a solution for diagonals.
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on? Graphical interface would be really cool. Playing against other players via online would be a fun feature to add.
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.  We used some driver navigator, ping pong, used a code spike to split off and find a solution.  We also used async coding for interation 4 to work on features seperatly.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. We were very open, about suggestions, back and forth feed back, stayed connected via phone, slack, and pull requests.  Neither was out of reach or out of commission for long.
